Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children(ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
ANS)
P(no.of  candies for randomly selected child) = (1*0.015)+(4*0.20)+(3*0.65)+(5*0.005)+(6*0.01)+(2*0.120) =3.09

Q11)Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?
Ans)sample size(n) = 2000                           population size(N) = 3000000
        Sample avg(x) = 200pounds
        Sample std(s) = 30
Formula for confidence interval:
Stats.t.interval(1-alpha,df=n-1,loc=samplemean,scale=samplestd/sqrt(n))

Ans) postive kurtosis means high peaked value and variance will be low 

Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?
Ans) negative kurtosis means low peaked value and vairance will be low and the curve will look like flat.

Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.
 
What can we say about the distribution of the data?
Ans) it is not symmetric and mean is not equal to median also so we can say distribution is not normally distributed.
What is nature of skewness of the data?
Ans) Left skewed distribution

3.	No skewness observed in both plots

Q 20) Calculate probability from the given dataset for the below cases

Data _set: Cars.csv
Calculate the probability of MPG  ofCars for the below cases.
MPG<- Cars$MPG
a.	P(MPG>38) 	
b.	P(MPG<40)
c.    P (20<MPG<50)
 
a.	P(MPG>38) = 0.3475
b.	P(MPG<40) = 0.729
c.   P (20<MPG<50) = 0.898












Q 21) Check whether the data follows normal distribution
a)	Check whether the MPG of Cars follows Normal Distribution 
        Dataset: Cars.csv
 

	Pvalue > 0.05 which means reject null hypothesis.
	Alternative hypothesis is cars[‘MPG’] follows normal distribution.

b)	Check Whether the Adipose Tissue (AT) and Waist Circumference(Waist)  from wc-at data set  follows Normal Distribution 
       Dataset: wc-at.csv
 
Both Waist and AT p values are less than 0.05
So fail to reject null hypothesis
Null hypothesis = Waist and AT are not follwing normal distribution.















Q 22) Calculate the Z scoresof  90% confidence interval,94% confidence interval, 60% confidence interval 
  
 

            Q 23) Calculate the t scores of 95% confidence interval, 96% confidence  interval, 99% confidence interval for sample size of 25 

 Q 24)A Government  companyclaims that an average light bulb lasts 270 days. A researcher randomly selects 18 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 260 days, with a standard deviation of 90 days. If the CEO's claim were true, what is the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days
Hint: 
rcodept(tscore,df)  
 df  degrees of freedom

ans)  sample size (n) = 18
	avg = 260
	std = 90
computing critical value(t) why because we don’t know population std.
formula for computing t value:
t =(samplemean – population mean)/(sample std/sqrt(n))
computing p values for critical values, as below
from scipy import stats
p¬_value = stats.t.cdf(t_value, df = n-1)
p_value = 0.32 =32%
